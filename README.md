FGFL (Fast Generate Fast Lexer) is a scientific tools.
The purpose of such tools is to create from lexical specification (lex/ folder)
a DFA ready for lexical analysis. Note that the DFA is suboptimal, in the future,
I attempt to fix this. Also for speed, maybe, I replace the Vector with Hash.
I also no free memory or only a subset. I try to fix this as soon as possible.
